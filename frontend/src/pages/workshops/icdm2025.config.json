    "introduction": "The increasing reliance on data mining techniques in critical decision-making systems has brought remarkable benefits across various domains, including finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, e-commerce, social networks,\nand scientific discovery. Data mining enables organizations to extract valuable insights from vast amounts\nof structured and unstructured data, driving innovations and improving decision-making.\nHowever, as data mining technologies become more sophisticated and widespread, concerns regarding their security,\nfairness, interpretability, and robustness are rising. The lack of transparency, bias in decision-making,\nvulnerability to adversarial attacks, and privacy risks are major challenges that hinder the responsible\ndeployment of data mining solutions in real-world applications. Trustworthy machine learning is emerging\nas a critical area of research aimed at ensuring that data mining models and algorithms adhere to principles\nof fairness, explainability, privacy preservation, robustness, and security. As organizations and individuals\nincreasingly depend on automated data-driven decisions, the need for reliable and responsible data mining methodologies\nhas become essential. This workshop seeks to bridge the gap between data mining advancements and trustworthy AI, bringing\ntogether researchers and practitioners to discuss the latest developments, theoretical foundations, and practical applications\nof trustworthy data science. This workshop will focus on exploring the core principles, methodologies, and real-world applications\nof trustworthy machine learning. Through technical discussions and knowledge exchange, we aim to advance responsible data\nmining practices that align with societal and ethical expectations.",
